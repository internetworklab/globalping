# My Globalping

Well, this is my own toy globalping, and it has nothing to do with the more famous and more official [globalping.io](https://globalping.io), I write this code for personal interests and for fun, and I am just happy to experiment with networking technologies like sending and receiving raw IP packets, or deploying a global distributed system and securing it with mTLS.
